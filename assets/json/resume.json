      }I am a researcher focused on applying machine learning to computational biomedicine, with an emphasis on multimodal data integration, cohort generalization, and immune response modeling. My work involves analyzing large-scale biological and clinical datasets using tabular machine learning approaches, with attention to model interpretability, metadata harmonization, and cross-cohort validation. I am also exploring privacy-preserving strategies to support decentralized, collaborative biomedical research.
